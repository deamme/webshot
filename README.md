# Webshot
Screenshot websites as a service.

The images are getting cached for 1 minute and only the first load takes some time to process.

## How to Use

Simply add the link of the website you want to screenshot to the end of https://webshot.deam.io/.

Example, to grab a screenshot of https://www.google.com/ use: https://webshot.deam.io/https://www.google.com/
