# Webshot
Screenshot websites as a service.

The images are getting cached for 1 minute and only the first load takes some time to process.

## Use cases
- You could use this as a preview image for your website in `og:image` or `twitter:image` (tutorial [here](https://dev.to/deam/easy-social-media-preview-card-generation-1ln7))
- Grab a screenshot of a bug in production, send the link instead of an image
- Constantly updated site showcasing for your portfolio
- Hotlink images directly to blog posts
